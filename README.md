# Cloud-based-online-election-managment-system

This is a web application project developed using the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architectural pattern and the Spring framework. The application uses MySQL as the database management system and is locally deployed.

## Project Overview
The web application is a final year group porject in my Undergraduate degree. It was designed to facilitate users to caste votes outside the country as well. It follows the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architectural pattern, which separates the presentation layer from the business logic and data access layer. This promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability.

The project utilizes the Spring framework, a powerful and widely adopted Java framework for building web applications. Spring provides a comprehensive set of tools and features, such as dependency injection, MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, and robust database integration.

MySQL is used as the database management system, providing a reliable and scalable storage solution for the application's data.

It was aslo integrated with a biometric device, which was used to ensure that the person casting the vote is the one registered under the Nadra Office (Official Registring authority in Pakistan) as well.
